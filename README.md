Ever used DropBox, Sendspace, or any other file drop service?

This project will allow you to have a similar ability to send lots of large files directly from your server

You drop your files onto the form, add a recipient email, description, and subject line hit send. 
Thats it. 

Of course some configuration will be needed :)
